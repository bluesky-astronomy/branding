# Branding

Branding resources and logos for the Astronomy feeds. (v2 update: December 15th, 2025).

The current logos were designed by Janine Jochum in 2025.

The logos are made using Affinity Designer v2, with everything contained in the file `branding.afdesign`.

**For printing:** the `print_ready` folder contains a version of the main logo ready to print as a sticker (converted to CMYK colours for printing.)


## Licensing

The final versions of these logos are listed under an MIT license.

Some emoji from the [Google Noto Emoji font](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/tree/main) were used in earlier versions of the project's design and have a separate license reproduced here in LICENSE-EMOJI (OFL-1.1 license). These emoji are being phased out, but are kept here for now.
